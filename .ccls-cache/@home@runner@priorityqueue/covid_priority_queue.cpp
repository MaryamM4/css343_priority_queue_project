 * CSS 343 HW 1: Priority Queue
 * ==============================
 * Maintain a priority queue for covid vaccination that
 * is determined based on the following:
 *
 * - Age of the patient (Older patients get higher priority)-
 *   patients under 5 are not enlisted into the queue.
 *
 * - Existing illnesses (you can assume this is a binary field
 *   that has the highest priority)
 * ==============================
 * Implemented by Maryam M, 2024
